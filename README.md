 Abstract: The sentiment analysis model for public health monitoring that is being presented makes use of cutting-edge deep learning techniques to examine opinions posted on social media. The model, which was trained over 10 epochs, shows a validation accuracy of 72.9%, balanced F1-score, recall, and precision for both positive and negative feelings. The design of the model consists of densely linked layers, bidirectional LSTM, convolutional, and embedding layers. The ReduceLROnPlateau callback facilitates changes in learning rate. Prospects for forthcoming advancements encompass investigating substitute frameworks, integrating pre-conditioned language models, broadening and varying the dataset, and merging instantaneous sentiment analyses into public health measures. Because of its sophisticated comprehension of attitudes towards certain health-related issues, the model is a useful tool for policymakers to assess public opinion and design focused solutions.
