 Abstract: The sentiment analysis model for public health monitoring that is being presented makes use of cutting-edge deep learning techniques to examine opinions posted on social media. The model, which was trained over 10 epochs, shows a validation accuracy of 72.9%, balanced F1-score, recall, and precision for both positive and negative feelings. The design of the model consists of densely linked layers, bidirectional LSTM, convolutional, and embedding layers. The ReduceLROnPlateau callback facilitates changes in learning rate. Prospects for forthcoming advancements encompass investigating substitute frameworks, integrating pre-conditioned language models, broadening and varying the dataset, and merging instantaneous sentiment analyses into public health measures. Because of its sophisticated comprehension of attitudes towards certain health-related issues, the model is a useful tool for policymakers to assess public opinion and design focused solutions.

Conclusion:The sentiment analysis model has shown promising performance in public health monitoring, with a progressive learning curve after 10 epochs of training. The model achieved an accuracy of 72.9% in the validation set, indicating a reliable capacity to categorize attitudes in health-related public discourse. The model's balanced performance is evident in accuracy, recall, and F1-score measures for both positive and negative sentiment classes. The training process can be improved by using a dynamic learning rate adjustment using the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler. The confusion matrix shows consistent accuracy, recall, and F1-score for both positive and negative attitudes, indicating a balanced performance. However, there is room for improvement in prediction ability, hyperparameter tweaking, and other assessment measures. Further research and development could lead to more precise and perceptive sentiment analysis results in the ever-changing public health discourse environment.

Future Work:The sentiment analysis methodology for public health monitoring offers a robust framework for understanding and analyzing public opinions on health-related social media topics. However, there are potential areas for improvement to ensure its continued effectiveness. These include exploring deep learning architectures, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and using pre-trained language models. Increasing the dataset's diversity can enhance the model's ability to generalize to a wider range of attitudes and subjects, especially in the context of public health discourse.
Future research should also explore how sentiment analysis findings can be applied to real-time public health initiatives, such as automated alarm systems or decision-support tools. Additionally, the model's aspect-based sentiment analysis capabilities could be improved, providing policymakers with more practical information on specific public health issues.
Context-aware sentiment analysis and user demographics could provide a more nuanced understanding of public health views, potentially leading to tailored therapies. Privacy protections and ethical issues should be prioritized in new innovations, as sentiment analysis in the public health sector involves analyzing user-generated information.
